             Since I was young, I have been curious to try new things, to learn new cultures or a new language. I was born with a rebellious nature; I haven‚Äôt been following what the trandtional values - simply to be a small part of the grand united society. And this rebellious spirit led me to Israel, nowadays as a converted Jewish woman working in HighTech. I found that I am interested in coding after 3.5 years working in the high-tech industry. It's always amazed me how coding can benefit our life and make information easier to be approached between users. By working day to day closely with programmers in Google, I am inspired by their passions, ambitions, social responsibility, and impacts to the world.

            <p >As a woman in high-tech, my former manager Hila was the one who introduced me to this amazing coding world. I quickly came to understand that code is a superpower every young woman should be able to access. Understanding that code is the underlying (and invisible) framework of tech means that we do not have to be passive bystanders in our ever-changing digital world.</p>

                  ‚ÄúWhether we‚Äôre fighting climate change or going to space, everything is moved forward by computers, and we don‚Äôt have enough people who can code. Teaching young people to code early on can help build skills and confidence and energize the classroom with learning-by-doing opportunities.‚Äù

              Also, the coding languages become more and more useful not only for programmers but also for researchers, for AI and ML scientists, for data scientists etc. It's so useful in many aspects of our lives. I hold a master degree in Environmental Studies. I've always thought about developing a useful platform which can integrate data, monitor the environment effects, and bring some impacts and awareness to our planet earth.

              Coding languages are international without borderies. By coding, programmers are connected from every corner of the world. The beginning of 2020 wasn't pleasant for most of us. By coding like luaching Kaggle Covid-19 data set Challenge etc. programmers are bringing joint efforts to fight against the virus together.
